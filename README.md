## DEAL OR NO DEAL

This project simulates the mechanics of Philippines' version of the TV gameshow program Deal Or No Deal. The game runs in a console application, providing users with easy to follow instructions to complete the game.
This is a passion project that I wanted to create ever since I failed to complete this project back when I was in college. I'm planning on creating a web application version but I figured I should start by developing the
game logic in my main programming language, C#.

 This project is developed with coding best practices in mind. I also aim to develop my unit testing habits in order for me to come close to my goal of mastering the Test Driven Development approach.
